# AI-Powered Interview Scheduler

An intelligent scheduling system that automates the interview process using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **email with Calendar Integration**. This system simplifies the interview scheduling process by parsing free-text availability, finding optimal interview slots, and managing notifications and calendar events using emails seamlessly.

## System Architecture

The AI-Powered Interview Scheduler is designed with a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. Below is the high-level system design:

### Architecture Diagram
![System Architecture Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=System+Architecture+Diagram)

The system consists of the following **core components**:

1. **FastAPI Application (`main.py`)**  
   - Acts as the core API server.
   - Handles RESTful endpoints for user management, availability parsing, and interview scheduling.
   - Manages background tasks for notifications.

2. **Natural Language Processing (`nlp_module.py`)**  
   - Parses free-text availability descriptions using **spaCy**.
   - Extracts dates, times, and time ranges from user input.
   - Converts natural language into structured availability slots.

3. **Machine Learning Scheduler (`ml_module.py`)**  
   - Finds optimal interview slots based on availability overlaps.
   - Scores potential slots using heuristics and ML models.
   - Considers factors like time of day, candidate priority, and historical patterns.

4. **Email Notifications (`email_module.py`)**  
   - Sends customized emails to candidates and recruiters.
   - Provides interview confirmations, reminders, and rescheduling notifications.
   - Uses HTML templates for professional communication.

5. **Calendar Integration (`calendar_module.py`)**  
   - Interfaces with calendar services (e.g., Google Calendar) to create and manage events.
   - Sends calendar invitations to all participants.
   - Handles scheduling logistics.

6. **Database Management (`database_models.py`)**  
   - Manages data storage and retrieval operations.
   - Handles user profiles, availability records, and interview schedules.
   - Provides CRUD operations for the application's data entities.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Parsing**: Converts free-text availability into structured time slots.
- **Optimal Slot Selection**: Uses ML to find the best interview times based on availability and preferences.
- **Automated Notifications**: Sends emails and calendar invites to all participants.
- **Calendar Integration**: Syncs with popular calendar services for seamless event management.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design ensures easy maintenance and scalability.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm (for frontend)
- SMTP server access for email functionality
- Calendar API credentials

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/smkCreator/AI_scheduler.git

2. Create an env and install the requirements from requirements.txt :
   ```bash 
    pip install -r requirements.tx

3. Download the SpaCy English language model: 
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
4. Run main.py :
   ```bash 
    python main.py 


## Future improvements

The AI-Powered Interview Scheduler is a robust system, but there are several areas where it can be enhanced to provide even more value and functionality. Below are some potential future improvements:

### 1. **Enhanced NLP Capabilities**
   - **Support for Multiple Languages**: Extend NLP capabilities to parse availability in languages other than English.
   - **Contextual Understanding**: Improve the system's ability to understand context (e.g., "I'm free after 3 PM except on Fridays").
   - **Ambiguity Resolution**: Add logic to handle ambiguous inputs (e.g., "next week" without specifying a day).

### 2. **Advanced Machine Learning Models**
   - **Predictive Analytics**: Use historical data to predict the best interview times based on candidate and recruiter behavior.
   - **Dynamic Prioritization**: Implement dynamic prioritization of candidates based on urgency, role, or other factors.
   - **Reinforcement Learning**: Use reinforcement learning to continuously improve scheduling algorithms based on feedback.

### 3. **Integration with More Calendar Services**
   - **Multi-Platform Support**: Add support for additional calendar services like Outlook, Apple Calendar, and Yahoo Calendar.
   - **Two-Way Sync**: Enable two-way synchronization to handle updates and cancellations directly from the calendar.

### 4. **Real-Time Collaboration Features**
   - **Live Availability View**: Allow recruiters and candidates to see each other's availability in real-time.
   - **Chat Integration**: Integrate a chat feature for quick communication between participants.

### 5. **Mobile Application**
   - **Native Mobile App**: Develop a mobile app for iOS and Android to provide a seamless experience on the go.
   - **Push Notifications**: Send push notifications for reminders, updates, and rescheduling requests.

### 6. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - **Customizable Templates**: Allow users to customize email and notification templates.
   - **User Feedback Loop**: Collect feedback from users to continuously improve the system.

### 7. **Scalability and Performance**
   - **Distributed Architecture**: Move to a distributed architecture to handle large-scale scheduling needs.
   - **Caching Mechanisms**: Implement caching to reduce latency and improve performance.

### 8. **Security and Compliance**
   - **Data Encryption**: Enhance data encryption for sensitive information.
   - **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

### 9. **Analytics and Reporting**
   - **Dashboard**: Create a dashboard for recruiters to view analytics and reports.
   - **Insights**: Provide insights into scheduling patterns, candidate behavior, and interview outcomes.

### 10. **AI-Powered Rescheduling**
   - **Automated Rescheduling**: Use AI to automatically suggest rescheduling options when conflicts arise.
   - **Conflict Resolution**: Implement conflict resolution algorithms to handle overlapping schedules.

### 11. **Voice and Chatbot Integration**
   - **Voice Input**: Allow users to input availability via voice commands.
   - **Chatbot**: Integrate a chatbot for natural language interactions and quick scheduling.

### 12. **Customizable Scheduling Rules**
   - **Recruiter Preferences**: Allow recruiters to set custom rules for scheduling (e.g., no interviews on weekends).
   - **Candidate Preferences**: Let candidates specify their preferred time slots and buffer times.
